__Intro__:   
Built models to increase the intention rate of the supplied list.

__Responsibilities__:    
Sorted out various types of customer features, including static tags, such as cars, houses, and education background, and dynamic tags, such as the number of calling our hotline, the number of clicks on some apps. Used XGboost algorithm to build customized models with Python for regression.

__Achievements__:    
AUC value hit 0.78, and the lift chart had a clear distinction. After the model was launched, the intention rate increased by 16%.
